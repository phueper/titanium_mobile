- notes

Contacts on Android are currently only read-only, so methods such as `createPerson`, `removePerson`, etc., are not supported.

`Titanium.Contacts.Person` objects which have been removed from the database are invalidated after a save operation, whether from creating a new contact or explicitly calling `Titanium.Contacts.save()`.  Using them may result in unpredictable beavhior, including crashes.

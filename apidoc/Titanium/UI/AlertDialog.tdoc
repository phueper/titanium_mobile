var alertDialog = Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({
	title: 'Hello',
	message: 'You got mail',
	buttonNames: ['OK','Doh!']
});
alertDialog.show();
~~~

- notes

the global method `alert` is aliased to this object and can be invoked with a single message. For example:

~~~
alert("this is a message");
~~~


Note: you should be careful not to call alert more than once while a pending alert is visible.

On iOS 4, alert dialogs will automatically be cancelled upon application suspend.
